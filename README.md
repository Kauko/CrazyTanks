This repo contains the Solum project and games based on it     

Solum
------

Solum is a small project I started back in the summer of 2012. I regularly attend gamejams and had often used XNA
in gamejam projects. I wanted to create a platform/engine/library of sorts that would contain all the basic
functions that are required in most games (camera, menu, controls etc.) and would be easy to expand upon. That is Solum.

Initially I never intended to make Solum public, and I used a local hg repo. Now however I made the decision to move
this to github.

Only one game so far has been made using Solum, as I've mostly moved away from using XNA. It could make more sense
to have that game in its own repo, but under the strict time line of SFGJ12 we decided to develop the game in its
own branch, and I probably won't ever clean that up. Some additions/bug fixes that are in the SFGJ12 branch should be
merged back to master, but that too is something I'll probably never do.
